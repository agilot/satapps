# SAT-Apps (Under construction)
SAT-Apps is a Scala library that tackles several NP-hard problems using Z3, an optimized SMT solver from Microsoft Research.

It also implements algorithmic data structures such as matrices, multisets, graphs and propositional logic.
## Currently the library tackles the following problems

### Graphs

- Graph coloring
- Independent set
- Clique
- Dominating set
- Domatic partition
- Maximum domatic partition / Domatic number
- Vertex cover
- Hamiltonian Cycle
- Hamiltonian Path

### Sets

- Set packing
- Set cover
- Partition
- Multiway number partitioning
- N-Partition
- 0-1 knapsack
- Bounded knapsack
- Unbounded knapsack
- Bin packing
### Games

- Sudoku
- N-Queens completion
- Blocked N-Queens
- Latin square


## We plan to add in the future
- Graph Isomorphism
- Presburger arithmetic
- Bounded Model Checking
